Lucky #13! Welcome to our 13th edition of "This Week in Nu". 

- We've just begun to create new websites. You can see the early versions live at [www.nushell.sh](http://www.nushell.sh) and [blog.nushell.sh](http://blog.nushell.sh). If you'd like to help or share your feedback, we'd love to have it! Big thanks to sebastian-xyz for kicking this off!
